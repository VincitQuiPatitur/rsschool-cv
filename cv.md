### About myself

I’m a Bachelor of Information Systems and Technology. When I was at university, I liked Web development, and I got a job in Information Systems Development and Administration Department. I independently developed landing for one department of the university on the WordPress platform. After that I began to study frontend.

I am interested in Web-development with a large range of interesting tasks. I like to learn something new, so I constantly develop in this field. I am interested in the development process and the visual result of my work. I’m responsible, I’m not afraid of difficulties in the work and I’m trying to improve. I like working as a team, but I can also work alone.

I love needlework, I constantly try new techniques. Like to travel, watch TV shows, snowboard.

### Code example

**Description:** Have a look at the following numbers.

```
 n | score
---+-------
 1 |  50
 2 |  150
 3 |  300
 4 |  500
 5 |  750
 ```
Can you find a pattern in it? If so, then write a function ```getScore(n)```/```get_score(n)```/```GetScore(n)``` which returns the score for any positive number n.

**Note:** Real test cases consists of 100 random cases where ```1 <= n <= 10000```

#### My solution:

```
function getScore(n) {
  let score = 0;
        for (let i=1; i<=n; i++) {
            score = score + 50 * i;
        }
        return score;
}
```
